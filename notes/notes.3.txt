HOW TO TRAIN A PERCEPTRION W/O API

answer: z = ReLU(x₁ + x₂ - 1.5)

loss function: Least Square Error
update the weights

w1 = w1 - s * L'w1
w2 = w2 - s * L'w2

Loss - take the derivative of the each step within the summation

ws are random at the begining. b is also completely random.

then you calculate

for int i = 4 {


}
