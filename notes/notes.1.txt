You input data and and answers then you find the rules.

The model is a mathematical formula. Polynomial is a model. A model describes a curve.

It is an underlying mathemtaical structure.

A general mathematical expression can be considered a model.

-- TAYLOR EXPANSION --

f(0) + (f'(0)/1!)x + (f''(0)/2!)x^2 + (f'''(0)/3!)x^3

This can be made to represent almost every function.

INNER PRODUCT

Everything is based off dot product.  SUM of Wi *Xi + b. W and X are both vectors and the offset.

You multiply and sum the vector products.

Activation function is the final part to complete every function. it is Non linear. RElu

LEARN ReLU(x) rectified linear unit

ReLU ignores negetive numbers and only uses positive numbers.

To train the model is to further narrow your function to create more and more granular results.

TO LEARN PARAMATERS AND FUNCTIONS. ITS MATH MAGIC.

EACH LAYER IS A ROTATION MATRIX?? you rotate the coordinate plane to map the data and classify.

secret number is 15
