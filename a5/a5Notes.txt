CHALLENGING BOUNDARY

input is (x,y)

next layer is fully connected large layer

output layer has two neurons using the one hot strategy

create a challenging example to support this hypothiesis
 - it doesnt matter how difficult the region is, with enough neurons you can model it accurately.



[IMPORTANT NOTES] {
    dont go more than two layers.
    dont do conv network use fully connected dense network.
}
